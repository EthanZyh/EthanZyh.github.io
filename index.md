## About Me

Hi! I am a 4th year undergraduate student at [SIST](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) of 
[ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) majored in Computer Science. 
My research insterests lie in making perception, reconstruction and rendering more realistic and 
efficient through creating breakthroughs in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. Specifically, 
I am exploring test time training on segmentation tasks and 3D reconstruction of human head from images.

I am honored to research under the guidance of [Prof. Jingyi Yu](http://www.yu-jingyi.com/cv/) and 
[Prof. Lan Xu](http://xu-lan.com/) in [VRVC Lab](https://vic.shanghaitech.edu.cn/vrvc/en/)
at ShanghaiTech University.
